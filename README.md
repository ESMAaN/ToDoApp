Problem Definition:

A ToDo application needs to be developed using Jetpack Compose to assist users in managing various tasks encountered in their daily lives. The application should be designed to allow users to easily record and manage their daily tasks.

Key features of the application should include:

Task Input: Users should be able to quickly and easily enter new tasks through the application. A user-friendly text input interface should be provided for adding tasks.

Task List: Tasks added by users should be displayed in a list format. Each task should have a title and, if necessary, additional details. Tasks should be listed in the order they were added, and users should be able to access them easily.

Task Management: Users should be able to manage the tasks they have added. This includes marking tasks as completed or no longer desired, as well as deleting tasks. Additionally, functions such as editing and prioritizing tasks may be useful for users.

User-Friendly Interface: The interface of the application should be easy to understand and use for users. A simple and minimalist design should be preferred, and basic functions such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks should be performed intuitively.

Reliability and Performance: It is important for the application to be reliable and performant. Tasks should be added and updated correctly, and the application should be available for use without any interruptions or performance issues.
